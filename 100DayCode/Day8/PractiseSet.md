1. Find the pair/pairs of the elements which having the largest product.

Example: {1, 5, 6, -3, 10, -10}
So, largest product is 30 here and it should return
{5,6} and {-3, -10}

2. Reshuffle a given array(array with all unique values, so no duplicate in array) in way so that, every odd(including 1 too) index should be larger than it's left and right.

Example:
input : {1, 3, 5, 4, 8, 10}
output: {1, 5, 3, 8, 4, 10}

here index 1, 3, 5, and so on are larger than it's left and right both.
