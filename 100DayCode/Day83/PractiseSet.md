Question 1:

Dividing Sequences
---------------------------
This problem is about sequences of positive integers a1,a2,…,aN. A subsequence of a sequence is anything obtained by dropping some of the elements.  
For example, 3,7,11,3 is a subsequence of 6,3,11,5,7,4,3,11,5,3 , but 3,3,7 is not a subsequence of 6,3,11,5,7,4,3,11,5,3 .  

A fully dividing sequence is a sequence a1,a2,…,aN where ai divides aj whenever i < j. For example, 3,15,60,720 is a fully 
dividing sequence.  

Given a sequence of integers your aim is to find the length of the longest fully dividing subsequence of this sequence.  

Consider the sequence 2,3,7,8,14,39,145,76,320  

It has a fully dividing sequence of length 3, namely 2,8,320, but none of length 4 or greater.  

Consider the sequence 2,11,16,12,36,60,71,17,29,144,288,129,432,993 .  
  
It has two fully dividing subsequences of length 5,  

2,11,16,12,36,60,71,17,29,144,288,129,432,993 and  
2,11,16,12,36,60,71,17,29,144,288,129,432,993  
and none of length 6 or greater.
